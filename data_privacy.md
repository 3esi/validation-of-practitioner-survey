# Privacy Policy / Declaration of Consent for the Research Project  
**“Validation of Practitioner Survey”**

## Purpose and Data-Collecting Body

The research project *“Validation of Practitioner Survey”* aims to evaluate the clarity and appropriateness of research questions and topics from a practitioner’s perspective, ensuring they are understandable and not overly complex or specialized. This feedback will help refine the pool of research questions and topics before they are used in the main study.

Personal data will be processed solely for the aforementioned research purpose by the **University of Leipzig, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Chair of Software Systems, Prof. Norbert Siegmund**. Processing includes the collection, storage, modification, and use of data. Voluntary and informed consent is required for this. The data will be used exclusively for analysis and will not be passed on to third parties. The results of the research will be anonymized so that no conclusions can be drawn about individuals.

## Data Processing

The declaration of consent includes the processing of the following personal data:

- Work experience  
- Highest level of education  
- Responses of test participants to questionnaires during the course of the study  
- Documentation of verbal responses given by the test participants during the interview  

## Anonymity

The data is collected in pseudonymized form. No direct personal identifiers are stored. However, due to the small sample size, it may still be possible to draw conclusions about individuals based on background information. We will handle the data with strict confidentiality and take all reasonable steps to minimize this risk.

## Data Transfer

Unless otherwise required by law or you have expressly consented in individual cases, personal data will not be transferred to third parties.

## Publication

The research results will be published in standard scientific form. We guarantee that no conclusions about identifiable individuals can be drawn from the published results.

## Voluntary Participation and Revocation

Participation in the research project is voluntary. Non-participation has no consequences! This consent can be revoked at any time in writing and informally to the data collection body and with effect for the future. In this case, write an email to **datenerhebung-sws@informatik.uni-leipzig.de** with the request to delete your data.

## Storage Period

All personal data will be anonymized upon completion of the research project, ensuring that no conclusions can be drawn about individuals.
